## How it works

This is a bitserial implementation of the SIMON Block Cipher.  SIMON
is a 128-bit block cipher, see `The SIMON and SPECK families of
Lightweight Block Ciphers <https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/404>`_. A
bit-serial implementation exchanges throughput for area, thereby
creating a compact cipher that is limited mostly by the amount of
state variables. A detailed description of the bitserial
implementation technique for SIMON is available in `SIMON Says, Break
the Area Records for Symmetric Key Block Ciphers on FPGAs
<https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/404>`_
